These models are evolving fast. Today, we can generate images with ease, solve complex problems in computer science, mathematics, physics, and more.\nBut can we really trust these tools?\n\nI don’t think so.\n\nToday, I was writing an article about *regression to the mean*. The equation is given by:\n\n> $\\mathbb{E}(Y|X) = \\alpha + \\beta X$\n\nMy goal was to explain the meaning of the regression coefficient and offer an intuitive technique to predict the value of $Y$ given a value of $X$. I assumed that the variances of $X$ and $Y$ were both equal to one, and that $X$ was centered (i.e., had mean zero). I then stated that under these conditions, the slope $\\beta$ is equal to the correlation between $X$ and $Y$.\n\nBut ChatGPT told me this was incorrect. It insisted that this only holds true if $Y$ is also centered.\n\nYet, we know that if both $X$ and $Y$ are scaled to have unit variance, then the slope of the regression is indeed equal to the correlation between them—even if $Y$ is not centered. That’s a basic identity in linear regression under standardized variables.\n\nSo while these AI tools can be helpful, they’re not always right. You still need to think critically, check the math, and trust your own understanding.\n\n\n\n::: {.byline}\n<span class=\"date\">May 11, 2025</span>\n:::\n\n\n## Sports Bring Us Together\n\nToday, like most days, I went for a run and stopped at the park to do some exercises—push-ups, a few pull-ups, and some jump rope.\n\nEvery time, I find it amazing. I meet people from all walks of life—different backgrounds, all genders, all ages. Some look wealthy, others look like they’re struggling. Some seem strong and healthy, others clearly carry the weight of illness. There are professionals and amateurs. Some are trying sports for the very first time—and probably won’t be back. Others stick with it for a while before giving up. And then, of course, there are the regulars who keep showing up.\n\nBut what stays constant is the atmosphere. It’s always welcoming. When you greet someone, they greet you back—with kindness. That simple act of saying hello when you arrive creates a sense of safety. You never know what might happen out there, but that greeting—it’s a small sign of trust, of connection. It reminds me of Marcel Mauss’s idea of the gift and counter-gift: you offer a smile, and in return, you receive not just a smile, but a sense of protection.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.byline}\n<span class=\"date\">May 11, 2025</span>\n:::\n\n## Why certain couples marry and others do not?\n\nToday, saturday, May 10 2025, I attended the wedding of a friend--a girl I met in high school. We were in the same grade from ninth grade all the way through senior year.\n\nShe was smart, almost among the top students in our class. She was attentive, displined, serious and hardworking. She rarely laughted out loud, but she always had a warm smile. Given her academic achievements and her work ethic, I expected her to pursue advanced studies and build a successful career. And that's exactly what happened--she went on to study at ENSAE, one of the most prestigious schools in France, and she is now an actuary.\n\nNow she is married too, and I hope she will find the same success in her marriage as she did in her studies and career. But this made me wonder: why do some people marry and others do not? What are the factors that influence the decision to marry?\n\nAt her wedding, I began to reflect on this question using the story of my friend as a starting point. First, she and her husband come from similar social backgrounds—which I believe played a stabilizing role in their relationship.\n\nThen, there was distance. After her master’s, she earned a scholarship to continue her studies at ENSAE and moved to Paris, while her husband remained in Cameroon. They had to maintain a long-distance relationship for two years and waited until the third year to get married. Despite the distance, they managed to stay connected and committed.\n\nLastly, their social circle made a real difference. The groom repeatedly thanked his friends during the ceremony for supporting their relationship. He said they reassured his bride during moments of doubt and helped keep them grounded and hopeful.\n\nBy the end of the ceremony, I had identified three key factors that seemed to have supported their union: shared social status, the ability to overcome physical distance, and the strength of their support network. I believe there are many other factors yet to discover, and I’m curious to explore what else might influence the decision to marry.\n\n\n::: {.byline}\n<span class=\"date\">May 10, 2025</span>\n:::\n\n## Regression to the mean\n\nRegression to the mean was discovered and named by Sir Francis Galton in the 19th century. It refers to the phenomenon where extreme observations tend to be followed by more moderate ones, and moving closer to the average. \n\nThis concept is often misunderstood, and interpreted in terms of causality. Take this proposition:\n> \"Highly intelligent women tend to marry men who are less intelligent than they are.\"\nWhat is the explanation?\n\nSome may think of highly intelligent women wanting to avoid the competition equally intelligent men, or being forced to compromise in their choice of partner because intelligent men do not want to compete with intelligent women. This explanation is wrong.\n\nThe correlation between the intelligence scores of spouces is less than perfect. If the correlation between the intelligence scores of spouses is not perfect( and if men and women on average do not differ in intelligence), then it is mathematically inevitable that the higly intelligent women will be married to men who are on overage less intelligent than they are.\n\n::: {.byline}\n<span class=\"date\">May 9, 2025</span>\n:::\n\n## Should You Invest, Save, or Keep Your Money Under the Mattress?\n\nA quick read of the bible can help you to answer this question. I recommend reading Mathieu 25:14, the parable of the servants and the master's reward.\n\nIn this parable, a master gives three servants different amounts of money to manage during his absence. The first servant receives five talents, the second two talents, and the third one talent. The first two servants invest their money and double it, while the third servant hides his talent in the ground.\n\nWhen the master returned from his journey, the first two servants presented their profits. The master was proud of them and rewarded them. But the third servant explained he knew that his master was hard and demanding. Because he was afraid of losing the money, he hid the talent in the ground. The master was angry and disappointed, and he took the talent. He told him that if he was so afraid, the least he could have done was put the money in a bank to earn interest.\n\nThis parable teaches us that the most important to get money is to invest it wisely. If you are afraid of losing your money, you should at least put it in a bank to earn interest. Keep money under a pillow is not a good idea, and should be used as the last resort.\n\n::: {.byline}\n<span class=\"date\">May 8, 2025</span>\n:::\n\n## How can we choose to modeling time series using ARDL?\n\nWhat ultimately determines the choice of a model is the data. This assumes that we’ve already carried out a preliminary analysis to understand the nature of the risk, define its scope, and identify the relevant risk factors.\n\nThat’s why it’s misguided to say, for example, that we should—or should not—use an ARDL model to analyze a time series. What truly matters is ensuring that the residuals of the model are not autocorrelated.\n\n::: {.byline}\n<span class=\"date\">May 7, 2025</span>\n:::\n\n## What drives stock prices?\n\nIt’s been about a week since I invested in Eutelsat stock at €3.59 through my PEA (Plan d’Épargne en Actions). When I woke up on Monday, May 5th, I was surprised to see that the stock had jumped to €4.20. Suddenly, it started dropping, and I was tempted to sell. Fortunately, I didn’t—because by the end of the day, the stock had climbed to over €4.65.\n\nThat’s a 29.5% increase relative to my investment:\n\n$$\n\\frac{4.65 - 3.59}{3.59} \\times 100 ≈ 29.5\\%\n$$\n\nNaturally, I started wondering what could have caused such a sharp rise. I looked it up on Google and checked the news on TV—but found nothing.\n\nLater that afternoon—maybe by chance, maybe because I had been actively searching—I stumbled upon an article in *Les Échos*. It mentioned that Eutelsat’s CEO, Eva Berneke, had been replaced by Jean-François Fallacher, the former CEO of Orange.\n\nThat was likely one reason for the stock’s spike. Another possible explanation is the French government's involvement with the company. In the context of European and French national defense, Eutelsat is seen as a strategic alternative to Starlink, SpaceX’s satellite internet service.\n\nIt’s incredibly hard to predict stock prices.\n\nOn a similar note, I also noticed that oil prices had dropped recently. And again, there’s a potential explanation: the number of oil producers within OPEC has increased by three. This rise in oil production leads to a greater supply, which in turn explains the drop in oil prices.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.byline}\n<span class=\"date\">May 6, 2025</span>\n:::\n\n## We are champions the champions : The first trophy of Harry Kane in his career.\n\nYesterday, after Bayer Leverkusen’s draw, Bayern Munich officially clinched the Bundesliga title. This marks the very first trophy of Harry Kane’s career.\n\nOne question comes to mind: Is this title more meaningful to Harry Kane than it is to other Bayern players like Thomas Müller or Manuel Neuer, who’ve already won countless trophies?I want to take it even further: Is Kane happier about this title than a die-hard Bayern Munich fan might be?\nTo answer those questions properly, we’d have to consider several factors—but let me just share my opinion.\n\nIt’s true that after a long, demanding season, winning a title is always a great source of satisfaction for any player. But for a club like Bayern Munich, winning the Bundesliga is important, yes—but it’s also expected. The fans and the club’s leadership invest a lot of money in top-tier talent to win the Champions League. So when you're a Bayern player, lifting the Bundesliga trophy isn’t enough—you need to win the Champions League to feel truly fulfilled.\n\nNow, for someone like Harry Kane, who’s never won a single trophy in his career and who’s been through a lot of disappointment and heartbreak—with Tottenham and even with England—this title must feel incredibly rewarding. Let’s not forget: he lost the Champions League final in 2019 with Tottenham against Liverpool, and the Euro 2020 final with England against Italy. People even started saying he was cursed.\nLet’s hope he fully enjoys this title—and that it’s just the beginning of many more to come with Bayern Munich.\n\n::: {.byline}\n<span class=\"date\">May 5, 2025</span>\n:::\n\n## Warren Buffett retires at 94\n\nThe most famous investor in the world, Warren Buffett, has announced his retirement at the age of 94 in the end of the year.

He is known for his long-term investment strategy, which focuses on buying and holding quality companies. He has also been a strong advocate of value investing, which involves looking for undervalued stocks with strong fundamentals. \n\nDo all these elements fully explain his success? I don’t think so. To explain his success, we also need to take luck into account. He wrote a book, and many others have written about him. But not many people have achieved the kind of success he has.\nThat’s why I want to propose a model to predict Warren Buffett’s success, which will be formulated as follows:\n\n\nSuccess = f(strategy, long-term investment, value investing, ...) + luck\n\n\n::: {.byline}\n<span class=\"date\">May 4, 2025</span>\n:::\n\n## Diagnostic de performance énergétique (DPE)\n\nLe DPE renseigne sur les performances énergétiques et environnementales d'un logement et d'un bâtiment, en évaluant ses émissions de gaz à effet de serre (GHG).\n\nLe DPE contient les informations suivantes :\n- Les informations sur les caractéristiques du bâtiment telles que la surface, les orientations, les mûrs, les fenêtres, les matériaux, etc.\n- Les informations sur les équipements du logement tels que le chauffage, la climatisation, l'eau chaude sanitaire, la ventilation, etc.\n\nLe contenu et les modalités du DPE sont réglementés.

Ce match opposait la meilleure attaque de la compétition, le barça, à la meilleure défense, l'Inter Milan. On s'attendait donc à un match difficile et fermé avec peu de buts. Cependant, on a assisté à spectable incroyable, magnifique et inoubliable. \n\nL'Inter Milan a ouvert le score grâce à un but superbe de Marcus Thuram au tout début du match. L'inter de Milan a même doublé la mise grâce à un but de Dunfries. On s'est dit en ce moment que c'est fini pour le barça. L'Inter Milan a commencé à défendre, à mettre le bus. Mais il a fallu que Yamal trouve la clé pour ouvrir le cadenas mis en place par l'Inter. \n\nAprès avoir effacé Henrikh Mkhitaryan avec une facilité déconcertante, le joyau de la Masia a fixé Alessandro Bastoni puis décoché un remarquable tir du pied gauche qui est aller fracasser le poteau droit de Yann Sommer avant de franchir la ligne.\nOn a vu en lui du Ronaldinho, du Neymar et même du Messi. On se pose même la question de savoir si c'est le nouveau Messi du Barça. Ce qui est sûr, c'est que Lamine Yamal est un génie, comme l'a dit son entraîneur, ancien entraîneur du Bayern Munich, Hans-Dieter Flick.\n\nIl est difficile de croire mais cet enfant sort de l'adolescence, mais il a une grande maturité. Il n'a que 17 ans et ce match est son 100e match avec le Barça. Il est le plus jeune joueur de l'histoire a avoir marqué en demi-finale de la Ligue des champions, dépassant ainsi le record d'un certain Kylian Mbappé.\n \nGrâce à lui, le Barça a pu arracher un match nul 3-3. Nous sommes impatients de voir Yamal briller lors du match retour à Milan.\n\n## Le livre des réponses\n\nJ'adore la bible parce que tu peux y trouver des réponses à toutes tes questions. Par exemple, si tu est quelqu'un qui travaille beaucoup et dort peu, si ton entourage te dit qu'il faut dormir, que le sommeil est réparateur. Si tu es fatigué par eux, tu peux leur répondre que d'après Proverbes 20:13, \"N'aime pas le sommeil, tu risquerais de t'appauvrir. Garde les yeux ouverts et tu seras rassasié de pain.\"\n\nLire la bible, notamment le livre des proverbes ou de l'Ecclésiaste, écrit par Salomon, te donnera de l'intelligence et de la sagesse. \n\n## Categories\n\nHow tall is Junior? If Junior is 1.5m. Your answer is a function of his age. He is very tall if I tell you that he is 6 years old. Very short if he is 20 years old. \nYour brain automatically returns the relevant norm, which allows you to make a quick decision.\n\nWe are also able to match intensity across categories and answer the question: \"How expensive is a restaurant that matches Junior's height?\"\n\nOur world is broken into categories for which we have a norm. And those norms allow us to make quick decisions.\n\n## What evokes you the 100 days of Donald Trump?\n\nEven if Trump sticks to his program, the first 100 days have nonetheless been marked by a major disruption in the global economy, which has had a negative impact on various markets, including Wall Street, the European market, and the Asian market. \n\nFurthermore, we were shocked by his stances on the war in Ukraine, his attack on the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, as well as the increase in tariffs — especially in the context of the trade war with China.\n\n::: {.byline}\n<span class=\"date\">May 1, 2025</span>\n:::\n\n\n\n## La puissance de la parole.\n\nLa bible met en évidence la puissance de la parole. Par la parole, Dieu à créé le monde. Pour des non croyants, ceci peut être ridicule. Je pense qu'ils conviennent avec moi que ceux qui maitrisent la parole ont un pouvoir. Ils peuvent séduire, enchanter, persuader, parfois ils peuvent même manipuler. \n\nDans la bible, notamment dans prophète, l'auteur préconise l'usage adéquat de la parole. Il dit que la langue, qui permet de parler, a un pouvoir de vie et de mort; ceux qui aiment parler en goûteront les fruits. Ensuite, il conseille de refléchir avant de parler. Celui qui répond avant d'avoir écouté fait preuve de folie et se couvre de honte.\n\nPlusieurs écrivaints ont souligné cette importance de la parole, notamment les mots. Jean Paul Sartre, un écrivain français, disait que \"Les mots sont des pistolets chargés.\" \n\n\n\n\n::: {.byline}\n<span class=\"date\">April 30, 2025</span>\n:::\n\n",
