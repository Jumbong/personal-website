It is important to understand them in order to have accurate estimates, validate models, and dealt with the uncertainty of the data. Indeed, **the resampling methods mesure the variability of statistics by using subsamples from the original data**. There are least four resampling methods: **bootstrap, jackknife, permutation test, and cross-validation** :\n\n| Resampling method | Applications | Type of resampling |\n|-------------------|--------------|--------------------|\n| Efron's bootstrap | Bias, variance, confidence intervals, hypothesis testing | With replacement |\n| Permutation test | Hypothesis testing | Without replacement |\n| Jackknife | Bias, variance, confidence intervals | Leave-one-out |\n| Cross-validation | Model selection, validation | Leave-p-out |\n\nThis document will focus on the permutation test. \n\n# General framework of the hypothesis test\n\nThe goal of statistics is to learn about a population by studying a sample. Often, we don't know the process that produced the sample. Mathematically, the sample is a random variable. \n\nLet $X = (X_1, X_2, \\ldots, X_n)$ be a sample of size $n$ drawn from a population or a probability distribution $P$. \n\nA hypothesis is a declarative statement about the population or the probability distribution. A hypothesis test involves two complementary hypotheses :\n\n- The null hypothesis $H_0$ : \"$P \\in \\mathcal{P}_0$\" where $\\mathcal{P}_0$ is a set of probability distributions.\n- The alternative hypothesis $H_1$ : \"$P \\notin \\mathcal{P}_0$\". \n\nA test $\\phi$ is a decision procedure between $H_0$ and $H_1$, given the sample $X$. \n$$\n\\phi(x) =\n\\begin{cases}\n    1 & \\text{reject} H_0 \\\\\n    0 & \\text{It is not reject} H_0\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\n\nA test $\\phi$ is defined using a real-valued test statistic $T(X)$ :\n\n- $\\phi(x) = \\mathbb{1}_{\\{T(x) > t_{\\alpha}\\}}$ where $t_{\\alpha}$ is the critical value of the test at level $\\alpha$. $H_0$ is rejected when $T(x) > t_{\\alpha}$.\n- $\\sup_{P \\in \\mathcal{P}_0} \\mathbb{E}_P \\{\\phi\\} \\leq \\alpha : \\text{ The law of } T \\text{ under } H_0 \\text{ is known}$.\n\n",
